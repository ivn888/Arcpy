# Python Add-In Wizard

This is the application linked to in the help for creating Python Add-Ins in ArcGIS 10.1/10.2. It's a simple wxPython app bundled with py2exe, so it should act as a good example to learn from for doing that, too.

This app does not require ArcGIS in any way to function, nor does it import or use arcpy/arcgisscripting in any way. It's just a UI to make boilerplate `.xml`/`.py` files.
